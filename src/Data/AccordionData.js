          Cryptocurrency is a network of computers that authenticates
          transactions using cryptography. Unlike fiat currencies, the world's
          central banks have no role in establishing and maintaining
          cryptocurrency's validity. Instead, all crypto transactions are
          recorded on public ledgers. As a result, blockchain-verified
          transactions are immutable and leave no chance for hackers to create
          fake transaction records.{" "}
